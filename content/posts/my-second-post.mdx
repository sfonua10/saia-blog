Elder Bednar shared lessons he learned by observing the behavior of cheetahs and topis. He said, “each of us should look for the lessons and warnings found in the simple events of everyday life. He talked about how cheetahs distract and try to deceive topis in order to secure them as a meal. As I read his talk, I thought of an experience I had being the one who intentionally attempted to distract my opponent while playing Chess. 

Quick side note about Chess: Chess is a board game for two players, played on a checkered board. You have a certain amount of game pieces. Your opponent has the same amount of game pieces. You move your game pieces to capture opposing pieces according to chess rules. The purpose of the game is to put the opponent’s king under a direct attack from which escape is impossible.

What I enjoyed more than playing this game was winning or beating my opponent at this game. I found myself playing against neighborhood friends and family members. To help me win, I would use the tactic of distraction. When I wanted to succeed at attacking a notable piece on the left side of the board, I would make gestures, comments, and reactions on the pieces relating to the right side of the board to get my opponent to focus his attention on the right side of the board, but in reality, I was set on attacking my opponent on the left side of the board. Sometimes my opponent would fall into the trap of getting distracted in which I would capture more pieces he did not see was coming from the other side of the board. This tactic helped me capture pieces and give me a more likely chance to win the game. 

What are some of the lessons we can learn from this simple and ordinary experience?
- We should all have a goal (commandments, God’s laws). Whatever distracts us from these goals (FB, Instagram, negative thoughts about others, etc) we should avoid these thoughts and get focus on our plan to accomplish these goals. 
- Don’t listen to the comments, reactions, noise from enemy, it’s intended to distract so he can destroy me.
- Play the game, and counter distract, but ultimately follow inspiration and gut feelings.
- Stay alert and vigilant!
