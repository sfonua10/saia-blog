CSS Selectors are a variety of characters that can be used in CSS to select HTML elements for the purpose of styling the markup. 

HTML elements are made up of tags, like so: <body><main><section><h1><p></p></h1></section></main></body>
These tags can have an id attributes, like so: <h1 id="heading"><p id="paragraph"></p></h1>
These tags can also have class attributes, like so: <h1 class="subject"><p class="note"></p></h1>
The tags can have a combination of both ids and classes, like so: <h1 id="greeting" class="heading">Learn Design</h1>

h1 {
  color: blue;
}

#greeting{
  background-color: white;
}

.subject {
  font-size: 100px;
}

These CSS Selectors are the main traditional ways to select elements to style. However, today, there are a lot more selectors to use to style certain elements. See MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors
