title: React's Context API in a Next.js app
date: 2020-04-10

Recently, as I was working on a moderately sized code base, I found a good use case for using React's Context API. The Project I was working on is a media library where users can search for media content such as videos, images, music and for most of the media items they can download it to their device or share it via Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest. 

A quick note on Next.js. Next.js, has a special directory called pages and whatever .js file that is created inside the pages directory becomes a page you can access on the url. So for example if there's a file called about.js in the pages directory, you can type in the browser url the domain name of your website forward slash, then the name of that file, and that routes users to a new page. 

This project is using Nextjs which allows you to write Reactjs code and serve that UI view from the server. In Next.js, we fetch data for our pages with their api called getInitialProps. You can fetch data from a third party api and it passes that as props to your page.

QUESIONS: 
What's the Context API?
Why would I care to use it?



NOTES: It's a stable API now. Something to use somtimes. It could potentially be useful.

Next has a getInitialProps api which fetches data serverside.
